# zk_wrapper ![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/meitu/zk_wrapper.svg?branch=master)

* Wrapper `chroot` for the go-zookeeper 

> It's much better to support this in go-zookpper, and i try to add `chroot` to go-zookeeper([https://github.com/samuel/go-zookeeper/pull/158](https://github.com/samuel/go-zookeeper/pull/158)), but got no response.

* Wrapper some helper functions, eg. `Mkdir/Delete Recursive`
